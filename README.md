Repo for HackerRank challenges

For starters, solutions will be implemented in Java for simplicity.

## JavaSolutions

Java 8 and IntelliJ IDEA 2017.2.1 will be used.  The `JavaSolutions` folder will be the root of the IntelliJ project.

For each challenge, a new Git branch and Java package will be created.  The skeleton solution code will be copied into a class of the proper name.  Once the challenge is completed, the branch can be merged into the master branch.
